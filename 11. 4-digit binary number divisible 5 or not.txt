11. Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma separated 4 digit binary numbers as its input and then check whether they are divisible by 5 or not. The numbers that are divisible by 5 are to be printed in a comma separated sequence.
Example:
0100,0011,1010,1001
Then the output should be:
1010

code:

items_list = []
num = [x for x in input().split(',')]
for p in num:
    x = int(p, 2)
    if not x%5:
        items_list.append(p)
print(','.join(items_list))

input:
0100,0011,1010,1001

output:
1010
