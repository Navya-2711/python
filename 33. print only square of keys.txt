33. Define a function which can generate a dictionary where the keys are numbers between 1 and 20 (both included) and the values are square of keys. The function should just print the keys only.

code:

sq = dict(enumerate([i ** 2 for i in range(1, 21)], 1)) 
for _, val in sq.items(): 
    print(val)
