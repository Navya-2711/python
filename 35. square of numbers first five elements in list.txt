35. Define a function which can generate a list where the values are square of numbers between 1 and 20 (both included). Then the function needs to print the first 5 elements in the list.

code:

def printValues():
    l = list()
    for i in range(1,21):
        l.append(i**2)
    print(l[:5])
printValues()

output:
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
