48. Write a program which can map() to make a list whose elements are square of numbers between 1 and 20 (both included).

code:

def sqr(x):
    return x*x
squaredNumbers = list(map(sqr, range(1,21)))
print (squaredNumbers)

output:
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144, 169, 196, 225, 256, 289, 324, 361, 400]
