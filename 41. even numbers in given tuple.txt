41. Write a program to generate and print another tuple whose values are even numbers in the given tuple (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10).

code:

evenTuple = (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
print("Tuple Items = ", evenTuple)
for i in range(len(evenTuple)):
    if(evenTuple[i] % 2 == 0):
        print(evenTuple[i], end = "  ")
output:
Tuple Items =  (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
2  4  6  8  10
