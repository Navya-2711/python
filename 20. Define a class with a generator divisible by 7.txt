20. Define a class with a generator which can iterate the numbers, which are divisible by 7, between a given range 0 and n.

code:

def generator(n):
    list_of = range(1,n+1)
    for i in list_of:
        if i % 7 == 0:
             yield i
print (list(generator(150)))

output:
[7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112, 119, 126, 133, 140, 147]
