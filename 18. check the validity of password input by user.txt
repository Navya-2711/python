18. A website requires the users to input username and password to register. Write a program to check the validity of password input by users.Following are the criteria for checking the password:
 At least 1 letter between [a-z]
 At least 1 number between [0-9]
 At least 1 letter between [A-Z]
 At least 1 character from [$#@]
 Minimum length of transaction password: 6
 Maximum length of transaction password: 12
Your program should accept a sequence of comma separated passwords and will check them according to the above criteria. Passwords that match the criteria are to be printed, each separated by a comma.
Example
If the following passwords are given as input to the program:
ABd1234@1,a F1#,2w3E*,2We3345
Then, the output of the program should be:
ABd1234@1

code:

user_input = input()
passwords = user_input.split(",")
special_chars = ["$","#","@"]
valid = []
for x in passwords:
    if(len(x) > 12 or len(x) < 6):
        continue
    if (x.isupper() or x.islower()): 
        continue
    has_number = any(char.isdigit() for char in x)
    if(not has_number):
        continue
    has_char = any(char in special_chars for char in x)
    if(not has_char):
        continue
    valid.append(x)
print(valid)
