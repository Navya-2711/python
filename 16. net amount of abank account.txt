D 100
W 200

D 300
D 300
W 200
D 100
Then, the output should be:
500

code:

balance=0
while True:
    s=input()
    if not s:
        break
    data=s.split(' ')
    Type=data[0]
    amt=int(data[1])
    if Type=='D':
        balance+=amt
    elif Type=='W':
        balance-=amt
    else:
        pass
print(balance)
